13. a) 32 since 3 is a character, not a number which means output will be 32 instead of 5 b) 1 since the subtract operator converts the 2 into a integer and subtract it with 1 c) 3 since null is equivalent to 0 which means the code is adding 3 with 0 d) 3null since 3 is a string, adding null will just combine it into a new string e) 4 since true is equivalent 1 which means the code is adding 1 with 3 f) 0 since null and false is both 0 g) 3undefined since 3 is a string, adding undefined will just combine it into a new string h) NaN since you can't subtract 3 with undefined
14. a) true since 2 is greater than 1 b) false since both 12 and 2 are both strings c) true since == does type coercion which means the string 2 is equal to integer 2 d) false because === doesn't do type coercion which means string 2 is not equal to integer 2 e) false since 0 is not equal to 2 f) true since Boolean(2) is equivalent to 2
15. The difference between == and === is that == will do type coercion while === doesn't do type coercion.

17. The result is [2, 4, 6]. This is the case because the doSomething() multiply each number by 2 and the modifyArray() replaces each number with the new number from doSomething().
